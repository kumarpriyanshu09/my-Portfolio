                This interactive Tableau dashboard explores the multifaceted impact of artificial intelligence on
                industries, employment patterns, and broader society. By visualizing comprehensive data on AI adoption
                trends, automation risks, and the evolving job market, this project presents a data-driven narrative of
                one of the most transformative technological shifts of our time.
